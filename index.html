            <p>My name is Keenan Mapp and as of this writing I am 31, a proud husband and father. My life has been filled with adventure, stories, mystery, and most notably learning experiences. After graduating from Penn State in 2010 with a bachelor's in Economics I spent the next 8 years in Financial Services
               in Financial Services developing and demonstrating skills in sales, operations, legal, audit, and reporting. However Career is just a small portion of my life. I love people and making new friends. I enjoy a great conversation over a cup of coffee and finding common ground. My favorite 
               TV Shows are the Walking Dead, Family Guy, South Park, Reign, 90s sitcoms like Martin. In terms of movie genres, I am huge fan of Action and Thrillers, although Comedies and Dramas are no strangers. I enjoy bright warm colors as they represent beauty, light and energy. I belive in God, Jesus Christ and the spiritual world that we cannot see.
